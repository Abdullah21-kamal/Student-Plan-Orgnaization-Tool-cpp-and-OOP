Study-Plan Organizational Tool (SPOT) is a tool that helps the students and academic advisors plan for the student roadmap to graduation
while spotting any violation to the graduation requirements. To facilitate the process a smart tool is needed to
make the students able to change their plans easily and try different scenarios that can lead to graduation smoothly, to be able to see the big picture
and choose the most suitable course plan depending on their needs. SPOT should be able to assist students to plan for completing their program/concentration requirements
, and to plan for any needed changes (repeating a course, changing Major, postponing courses, adding Minors, adding extra courses, etc).
Validating students' plans according to UST rules and graduation requirements can be in real-time and/or after the student finishes his/her planning
